# embedit

`embedit` is a command line tool for performing bulk operations on text files (e.g. a package) with OpenAI's API. It currently provides two commands: `search`, which performs semantic search on text files using embeddings, and `transform` which performs arbitrary transformations using a custom prompt.

*Can't I just feed my files to the API directly?*

You could. But transforming each file independently could lead to inconsistent behaviour across your project. `embedit transform` combines your files together in a single prompt, so that they can be transformed in a coherent way, and then splits the result back into individual files.

## Installation

Install `embedit` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install embedit
```

This will install `embedit` and its dependencies, including `openai`. You will also need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key if you haven't already done so.

## Usage

`embedit` provides two commands: `search` and `transform`.

### Search

`embedit search` performs semantic searches on text files. You specify a search query and a list of text files to search, `embedit` will fetch text from the files, split them into segments, embed them using OpenAI's API, and print them out in order of cosine distance to the query.

```bash
embedit search "search query" file1.txt file2.txt ...
```

#### Options

- `--order`: the order in which the results should be displayed (ascending or descending by similarity score). Default: `ascending`.

- `--top-n`: the number of top results to display. Default: `3`.

- `--threshold`: a similarity threshold below which results should be filtered out. Default: `0.0`.

- `--frament_lines`: the target fragment length in number of lines. Default: `10`.

- `--min_fragment_lines`: the minimum fragment length in number of lines. Default: `0`.

### Transform

The `transform` command allows you to transform one or more text files by passing their markdown representation with a given prompt to the OpenAI API.

```bash
embedit transform **/*.py --prompt "Add a docstring at the top of each file" --output-dir out
```

#### Options

- `--files`: One or more text files to transform.
- `--transformation_fn`: The function to apply on the files.
- `--output_dir` : The directory to save the transformed files.
- `--yes`: Don't prompt before creating or overwriting files.
- `--engine`: The OpenAI API engine to use.
  - Defaults to 'text-davinci-003'; however, if you have access to "code-davinci-002", I recommend using that instead.
- `--verbose`: Whether to print verbose output.
- `--max_chunk_len`: The maximum length (in characters) of chunks to pass to the OpenAI API.

## Tips

You can also use wildcards to specify a pattern of files to search in. Here's an example of how you can use the `**` wildcard to search for Python files in all directories in the current directory and its subdirectories:

```bash
embedit search "query" **/*.py
```

Bear in mind that the behavior of the `*` and `**` wildcards may vary depending on your operating system and the terminal shell you're using.
